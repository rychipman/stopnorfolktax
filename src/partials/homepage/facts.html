    <p><span class="emph">$4 Million Unaccounted For</span> - In May 2014, the Norfolk Town Administrator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2FviVUVrm8&t=9060" target="_blank">stated</a> and later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2FviVUVrm8&t=9765" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the project would cost only $10 Million. The amount of the proposed override is now $14 million, a <span class="emph">40% increase</span> over the original amount authorized by town meeting.</p>

    <p><span class="emph">Increased Response Times</span> - The proposed location of the new police station is at the far corner of Norfolk, by the Wrentham and Foxboro town lines. The proposed location is more than twice as far away from Norfolk communities such as <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sharon+Ave,+Norfolk,+MA+02056/Village+At+Rivers+Edge,+Winterberry+Way,+Norfolk,+MA/@42.1079263,-71.3490354,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e47b4cd959323b:0xcf64b9d862d51337!2m2!1d-71.3047771!2d42.0902138!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e47a57be788727:0xd485a01285d32d92!2m2!1d-71.3435799!2d42.1358707!3e0" target="_blank">Village at Rivers Edge</a> than the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Norfolk+Police+Department,+Main+Street,+Norfolk,+MA/Village+At+Rivers+Edge,+136+Winterberry+Way,+Norfolk,+MA+02056/@42.1281935,-71.3422504,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e47b10744ec9c1:0x6b2a586a9c5ce29b!2m2!1d-71.3229306!2d42.1195475!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e47a57be788727:0xd485a01285d32d92!2m2!1d-71.3435799!2d42.1358707" target="_blank">current location</a> in the center of town.</p>

    <p><span class="emph">Construction Costs Unknown</span> - The Town Administrator is on record as of January 7, 2016 saying that "We haven't had the architect go to the cost estimator for this building yet", in reference to the proposed addition, remodeling, and upgrades to the existing Public Safety building. The town is asking you to hand over money for this project without even seeking an accurate cost estimate first.</p>

    <p><span class="emph">Inconsistent Justifications</span> - In _________, Police Chief Chuck Stone <a href="#a_link" target="_blank">_____i dont know what he actually said____</a>. But in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2FviVUVrm8&t=9475" target="_blank">May 2014 he stated that</a> "99% of the time we're out on the road already" when responding to a call. If officers are already in their cars for 99% of calls, defrosting shouldn't be an issue.</a></p>
