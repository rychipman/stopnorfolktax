<h2>Why</h2>
<h3>How does this affect you?</h3>

<div class="text-area">
    <p>Norfolk has one of the highest tax "TAKES" in the Metrowest area.

This indicates a spending problem. It is bad enough we get killed on Beacon Hill and Washington  but at least we can do something about on a local level.  JUST SAY NO !

So before you or your escrow account has to pay the recently INCREASED tax bill just received you get to vote on yet another increase.</p>
